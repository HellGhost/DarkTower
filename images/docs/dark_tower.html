You've made it! You're now in the Dark Tower.  Before battling the Brigands inside you must solve The Riddle of the Keys.  A key will be shown to you.  If you think that key is the next key in sequence press Yes/Buy.  If you are correct then another key will be shown.  If you've gotten all three keys correct then the battle is on!  If you are incorrect then your turn ends.  Fear not, you can try again on your next turn.
    <p/>
    If you don't think the key shown is next in sequence tap on No/End.
    <p/>
    You may drag the keys you've collected (bottom-right corner) anywhere you wish to aid you in remembering the key sequence.
