<p/>
<b>The Challenge:</b> to retrieve the Ancient Magic Scepter that has been stolen by a tyrant king. The Scepter is the Power Staff of the 
Empire, and a kingdom has been offered as reward for its return. The Scepter lies hidden in the Dark Tower, guarded by a fierce band 
of the tyrant's Brigands. Three magic keys will open the the tower to you. Find the keys in three foreign kingdoms, and you may lay siege 
to the Dark Tower.
<p/>
In search of the key, leave the Citadel in your home kingdom with a handful of warriors. On your journey, you will fight battles, 
be attacked by dragons, lose warriors to plague and starvation and get hopelessly lost in uncharted territories.
<p/>
But don't despair! Visit the Bazaars to buy warriors and other supplies. Stop at the Tombs and Ruins to discover treasures of gold, 
dragonswords, magic keys, helpful wizards and the flying horse, Pegasus. The Sanctuaries are open to you, too, ready to outfit you 
with warriors, gold and food.
<p/>
Once you discover the three keys, begin your siege of the Dark Tower. Start out by solving the Ancient Riddle of the Keys, then fight 
the Brigands within!
<p/>
If you have a stout heart, quick wits and undying courage, you will retrieve the Scepter, save the Empire and win a Kingdom. <b>Dare to Lay 
Siege to the Dark Tower!</b>
