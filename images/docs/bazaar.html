    The Bazaar is where you can buy supplies for your mission. An item will be shown to you. Tap No/End if you wish to move on to the
    next item. Press Yes/Buy if you wish to purchase the item. You may haggle for a better price by tapping the Haggle button. Be warned: if you haggle too much you will
    anger the merchant and get nothing!
