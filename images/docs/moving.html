Frontier, or Dark Tower see the appropriate section to the left.  If not, read on...

Events can happen to you when you move.  If your hero moves and you just see your player number flashing then nothing happened. You're safe! 
But you won't always get that lucky.  Events you might encounter are:

            <td valign="top">The forest can be a diseased-filled place and your warriors may get hit with a plague. If
    they do you will lose two of them unless you have hired a Healer (see Bazaar).  In that case you will gain two warriors.  We aren't sure how 
    that works exactly (the Healer being able to create warriors) but that's just the way it is!</td>

            <td valign="top"><img src="lost.jpg" width="80px" align="left"></td>
            <td valign="top">Your warriors have become lost.  Your hero won't even move to the space you tapped on.  However,
    if you have purchased a Scout (see Bazaar) not only will your hero move but you will be able to take another turn.</td>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top"><img src="dragon.jpg" width="80px" align="left"></td>
            <td valign="top">A Dragon lurks in the kingdom! If you are attacked by the Dragon you will lose 25% of your
    warriors and gold. If are lucky enough to have a Dragonsword (see Combat) you will slay the beast and collect any gold and warriors it has 
    accumulated at this point.  Why the Dragon keeps warriors instead of eating them, who knows!
    <p/>
    Whether you kill the Dragon or not you may place the Dragon to slow down one of your opponents. Tap on the left and right arrow buttons on the edges of the screen to move through the kingdoms.  Then tap on the target icon of the space you wish to place the Dragon. No one can move into a space with the Dragon.  When you are finished tap No/End to end your turn.
