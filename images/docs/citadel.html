    When you get back to your home kingdom you will want to visit your Citadel at some point.  When you visit, your warriors will be doubled!  That is provided you have 24 or fewer.  As long as you have 24 or fewer you may come back any time you wish to double your warriors.  The only thing you must do is visit a tomb or ruins between visits.
    <p/>
    Visiting a Citadel in another kingdom will do nothing.
