<h1 style="text-align: center">Frontier</h1>
<p/>
You must enter the Frontier to move into another kingdom.  If you're next to the Frontier and there is no move icon then you don't have the proper key. You can always tell if you can move into the Frontier by looking at your keys in the lower-right corner of the screen.  If you see "You may move to the Frontier" then, guess what? You may move to the Frontier!
