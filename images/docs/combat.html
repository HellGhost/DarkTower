What's adventuring without combat? Boring! When you first enter combat you are shown the number of enemies you are facing. Then you will be shown the number of Warriors you have. Then again the number of enemies remaining after the first round.  The next round will commence and you will see your Warriors remaining and then the enemies remaining.  And so on until you defeat the enemies, they defeat you, or you retreat.
    <p/>
    <img src="brigands.jpg" width="80"> Brigands are the most common enemy you'll face. If you have not purchased the Enemies & Helpers expansion they will be the only ones you encounter.
    The Brigands numbers drop by half (rounded down) each time they lose a round. Each time you are defeated you lose one warrior.
    <br/>
    <img src="goblins.jpg" width="80"/> Goblins will attack you in greater numbers than the Brigands. However, they are are easier to defeat. If they are victorious in a round of battle they will steal something from you! <b>Available only in the Enemies & Helpers expansion (see Store).</b>
    <br/>
    <img src="ogres.jpg" width="80"/> Ogres are about as tough as Brigands. However, they're numbers only reduct by 25% when you win a battle round. But if you defeat them you will get a sword! <b>Available only in the Enemies & Helpers expansion (see Store).</b>
    <br/>
    <img src="trolls.jpg" width="80"/> Trolls are tough to defeat unless you have a sword. Each round they win you will lose two warriors. Each round you will their numbers will reduce by 25%. If you defeat them you will get Pegasus! <b>Available only in the Enemies & Helpers expansion (see Store).</b>
    <br/>
    <p/>
    <h2>Victorious!</h2>
    If you defeat the Brigands you may get something. You will always get gold (unless you're in the Dark Tower or you do not have enough warriors or a beast to carry it).  You may also get:
